# Trade Alerts App Icon

## Instructions to Create Custom App Icon

1. Create a 1024x1024 PNG image named `app_icon.png` in this directory
2. Design should include:
   - Trading/financial theme (trending up arrow, chart, etc.)
   - Blue color scheme (#1976D2) to match the app
   - Clean, modern design that works at small sizes
   - White or light background

## Suggested Design Elements:
- Trending up arrow icon (ðŸ“ˆ)

## Alternative Quick Solution:
You can use any 1024x1024 PNG image as a placeholder, or create one using:
